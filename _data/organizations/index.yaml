  name: Certificate Transparency
  description: Google's Certificate Transparency project fixes several structural
    flaws in the SSL certificate system, which is the main cryptographic system that
    underlies all HTTPS connections. These flaws weaken the reliability and effectiveness
    of encrypted Internet connections and can compromise critical TLS/SSL mechanisms,
    including domain validation, end-to-end encryption, and the chains of trust set
    up by certificate authorities. If left unchecked, these flaws can facilitate a
    wide range of security attacks, such as website spoofing, server impersonation,
    and man-in-the-middle attacks.

  description: The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. &sect; 552, is a federal
    freedom of information law that allows for the full or partial disclosure of previously

    The Act defines agency records subject to disclosure, outlines mandatory disclosure
    procedures and grants nine exemptions to the statute. It was originally signed
    into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson, despite his misgivings, on July 4, 1966,
    and went into effect the following year.
