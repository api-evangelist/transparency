    The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. &sect; 552, is a federal
    freedom of information law that allows for the full or partial disclosure of
    previously unreleased information and documents controlled by the United
    States government. The Act defines agency records subject to disclosure,
    outlines mandatory disclosure procedures and grants nine exemptions to the
    statute. It was originally signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson,
    despite his misgivings, on July 4, 1966, and went into effect the following
    year.

    Google's Certificate Transparency project fixes several structural flaws in
    the SSL certificate system, which is the main cryptographic system that
    underlies all HTTPS connections. These flaws weaken the reliability and
    effectiveness of encrypted Internet connections and can compromise critical
    TLS/SSL mechanisms, including domain validation, end-to-end encryption, and
    the chains of trust set up by certificate authorities. If left unchecked,
    these flaws can facilitate a wide range of security attacks, such as website
    spoofing, server impersonation, and man-in-the-middle attacks.
